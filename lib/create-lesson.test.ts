# Transformer Architecture

The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need," 
revolutionized natural language processing. Unlike traditional RNNs and LSTMs, 
the Transformer relies entirely on attention mechanisms, specifically self-attention 
and multi-head attention.

The key innovation is the ability to process all tokens in parallel, rather than 
sequentially. This is achieved through the self-attention mechanism, which computes 
attention scores between all pairs of tokens in the input sequence.

The Transformer consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of multiple layers. 
Each layer contains two main components:
1. Multi-head self-attention mechanism
2. Position-wise feed-forward neural network

The model also uses positional encodings to inject information about the position 
of tokens in the sequence, since the attention mechanism itself has no notion of order.
